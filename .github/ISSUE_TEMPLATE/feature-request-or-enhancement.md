Hi there! 👋🏻 We hope everything is fine using our projects from the Lyne Design System. It looks like you want to suggest a feature request or enhancement, so we wanted to share some resources that you could use if you have not tried them yet 🙂.

You can find the Lyne Design System documentation [here](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/docs). Also have a look at our [issues](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/issues) if your suggestion/enhancement has been proposed before.

If this is a specific feature request or enhancement concerning one of [our projects](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/README.md#our-projects) please raise the request there and have a look if it has already been raised. 

If these resources do not work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
details below!

Thanks in advance!
