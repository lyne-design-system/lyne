Hi there! üëãüèª We hope everything is fine using our projects from the Lyne Design System. It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to share some resources that you could use if you have not tried them yet üôÇ.

You can find the Lyne Design System documentation [here](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/docs). Also have a look at our [issues](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/issues) if your question/issue has been asked/raised before or even might have been solved.

If this is a specific question concerning one of [our projects](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne#our-projects) please raise the question there and have a look if it has already been solved. 

If these resources do not work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
