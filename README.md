## Our aim
To fulfill our [Vision](./docs/VISION.md), we are building and maintaining [Lyne](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#lyne), our [Design System](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-system), which is and acts as our common language —  our [Single Source of Truth](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#single-source-of-truth). For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-token) as our design abstractions. Those Design Tokens are consumed by [Lyne Components](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#lyne-components) via our [Design (Token) API](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-token-api) and are integrated within our documentation.
