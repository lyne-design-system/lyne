## Our aim
To fulfill our [Vision](./docs/VISION.md), we are building and maintaining [Lyne](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#lyne), our [Design System](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-system), which is and acts as our common language —  our [Single Source of Truth](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#single-source-of-truth). For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-token) as our design abstractions. Those Design Tokens are consumed by [Lyne Components](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#lyne-components) via our [Design (Token) API](./docs/TERMINOLOGY#design-token-api) and are integrated within our documentation.

## 🚀 Getting started

First things first: This repository acts as the entry point for everything related to the *Lyne Design System* and is it's common ground — it's common denominator. See [our projects](#our-projects) below for more details and their specific implementations.

### Documentation
Check the [docs](docs/README.md) directory for our documentation and resources which we will continuously enhance.
