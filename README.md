  Lyne Design System
</h1>

> *Lyne* is an open source Design System built by SBB–CFF–FFS. We provide a common [terminology](/docs/TERMINOLOGY.md), [working code](#our-projects), design decisions,
> resources and human interface guidelines which all together define our shared, common language.

## ⚠️ Notice
***Lyne Design System* is 🧪 experimental at the moment — with enthusiasm.<br>Don't use the project until it has left infancy.**.
<br>

<br>

## 🎯 Our aim
To fulfill our [Vision](./docs/VISION.md), we are building and maintaining [Lyne](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne), our [Design System](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#design-system), which is and acts as our common language —  our [Single Source of Truth](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#single-source-of-truth). For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#design-token) as our design abstractions. Those Design Tokens are consumed by [Lyne Components](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne-components) via our [Design (Token) API](./docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#design-token-api) and are integrated within our documentation.

Lyne Design Tokens and Lyne Components are available for developer and designer(coming).

## 🚀 Getting started

First things first: This repository acts as the entry point for everything related to the *Lyne Design System* and is it's common ground — it's common denominator. See [our projects](#our-projects) below for more details and their specific implementations.

### Documentation
Check the [docs](docs/README.md) directory for our documentation and resources which we will continuously enhance.
